5a) The output will be 2.
The Storage Capacity of byte is 256 so if we typecast in implicitly to int the difference I given as output i.e. if the byte value was 260 output would be 4 and if it was 250 output would be 6.


5b) The "p" in public is given to be Public where as it should be public because java is a Case Sensitive language so it will throw an error. If it is typo then the output will be sum=9 as a=4 and b=5 so when (a+b) is executed by the compiler in the print statement the values will be added up without being assigned to a variable and printed.


5c) The output will be 16.46666666666667.
The array num[ ] is initialized at the time of declaration with 6 values. The for loop run from value of I to be 0 till 6 i.e. the size of the array. The condition inside the array adds up the six values. As soon as the loop ends the print statement is executed and the total is divided by 6 and we get the final output. Since the data type of result is double so we get a decimal output even though we are dividing by an integer 6.


5d)The output will be 24
The value of g is 3 and f is 6. In the expression (++g * f++) g is having a prefix operator and f is having a postfix operator. So in case of g the value is incremented first and then used in the expression while in case of f the value is used in the expression first and then it is incremented. So ++3 * 6++ = 4 * 6 = 24.  


5e) The output will be 0 2 4 6 8
Inside the for loop the variable which runs the loop i.e. is being assigned to the array. We can see that each time the loops runs the value if I is being incremented by two. One due to the loop inc/dec part and other due to the last statement inside the loop block at the last. So each time the loop runs the value is being incremented by 2 and printed.
